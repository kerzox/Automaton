# Automaton
Steampunk inspired technology mod for minecraft. Prepare for Large modular factories running on heat, steam and all things steampunk.

Currently on hiatus.
TODO: 
- Rework conveyour belts and pipes. (mostly done)
- Add custom shaped crafting
- Rework "on conveyour belt crafting".
- Actually implement a IK solver or maybe hard code an animation for robot arms?
- Finish multiblock implementation. (Might change how managers work)
